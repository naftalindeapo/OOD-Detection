# Out-of-Distribution Detection
This is a simple unified framework for detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) images in neural networks for my research project [Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iYIQB629sgECxraShk7qWKXwe9dYhi2e/view?usp=sharing). This project explores OOD detection using multiple
techniques, including MaxSoftmax, OpenMax, Mahalanobis distance, energy-based methods, and ODIN, leveraging the pre-trained image classification models WRN-28-10 and Dense-BC.
